## Chapter 2 - Rut
The company went to the old mans friend named rut.
rut was an old lady who was nice. sometimes... she was really old and really smart. she probably could identify the island on the map.

The went there by bus.

When the came to her apartment they had to take the stairs becuas the elevator wasnt working. 

That was no problem since since rut had not left the apartment for 50 years since she started with soduko. she was really pursasive so she made all her friends and neigbours do her chours for her.

when they cmake into to her apartment they where shooket to see how nice and clean and shiny everything was there.

SHe also had bad hearing

she said that the island on the map was the skeleton island. a island in the wes indies that was wery hard to find. many had tried and died. but she knew how to get there.

So she invited herself. her demand was that rutger the old man. That was his name. had to coma along and also enough soduko so she would run out on the trip there and back.

nex day they waited on the dock for rut and rutger. and thhey cam in a really old car with a crank. they had pruple and green clothes on and mathcing lugcage bags.

On the ship hasse and bengt and frams and eskil had to do the cooking becuas grandma margaretha and grandma marie was tired of doing so.

Rutkger ate only knäckebröd and fruit.

marie and margaretha sat on deck when rut came by and told them that they should make a plan to survuve the islands all traps and har plces.

Frans took philip the lyckor frog to bed. and sang hinm a goodningt song. 

The went almost all the way island. according to rut there was just a week from ghetting there.
